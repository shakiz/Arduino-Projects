# Arduino-Projects

The Arduino UNO is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc.[2][3] The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits.This repository is only used for my practice work of arduino.

I have added the projects or code to blink a led light and added another project which can measure distance between the sensor and an object.
